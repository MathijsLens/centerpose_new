# Models: 

You can donwnload the modes from the sharepoint. 
put the pth files here. 


The 3 trained networks are: 

1. the pretrained_objectron.pth: trained for detecting cerealboxes, Objectron data

2. the background_random_best.pth: the best weights for the random background senario

3. the green_background_best.pth: the best weights for the green background model 

The files with "last" in the name are the last updateted weights (higher acc on the trainingset, lower on the validation set)
These networks overfitted the data.
